## Problem Statement

Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, the script converts it to military (24-hour) time format.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-conversion.git
cd time-conversion
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python time_conversion.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to provide the time in the specified format.

## Input Format

The script prompts you to provide the time in the following format:

```
hh:mm:ssAM or hh:mm:ssPM
```

## Example

Suppose you run the script and provide the following input:

```
07:05:45PM
```

The script will output:

```
19:05:45
```

This means that 07:05:45 PM in 12-hour format is equivalent to 19:05:45 in 24-hour format.
